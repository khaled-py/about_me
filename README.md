# Personal Info Chatbot

This repository contains a Python-based chatbot that answers questions about me using information stored in a JSON file. The chatbot reads data from `info.json` and responds to user queries interactively.

## Features

- **JSON-Based Data**: All information is stored in a structured `khaled.json` file.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: A Python script allows users to ask questions and get answers based on the JSON data.
- **Easy to Extend**: Add more information to the JSON file, and the chatbot will automatically use it.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
